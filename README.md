# KineCraft Library

The KineCraft Library is a module loader and framework for ComputerCraft. It aims to provide the following functionality:

* Downloading modules from online repositories (github/pastebin)
* Installing modules into versioned folders
* Managing dependencies between modules
* Providing a framework for modules to hook into
* An event system for inter-module communication

## Usage

The module is automatically downloaded into the versioned folder and is linked as the startup command

You can then download and install modules like this:

```lua
unimplemented()
```

This will download the example_mod.lua file from the repository specified in the file, determine its version, and install it into a versioned folder.

The installed module can then be required and used in your program.
